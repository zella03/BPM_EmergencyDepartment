Task 1 Emergency Department
Emergency patients come to the Hospital Emergency Department (open seven days a week/24 hours a day).

Patients report every 10 to 15 minutes (according to a uniform distribution) from 24:00 to 18:00
and every 1-5 minutes (according to a uniform distribution) from 18:00 to 24:00.
The patient reports to the registration desk, where a patient card is created, an initial interview
is conducted, and it is checked whether the patient is insured (if they are not insured, they agree
to cover the treatment costs). According to a normal distribution, it takes the person at
registration between 4 and 6 minutes.

Suppose it turns out that the patient does not qualify for a consultation at the Emergency
Department (20% of cases). In that case, they receive information about the groundlessness of
the admission and guidelines for further proceedings (visit to a primary care facility). According
to a normal distribution, it takes the registration clerk between 1 and 4 minutes to provide this
information.

The remaining patients are waiting for qualification (interview with a doctor). Information
about patient qualifications (code) and waiting time for a consultation (normal distribution
within the range) can be found in the table below. While you are waiting, a sudden event
changes the code to red. In 1% of cases, the patient is immediately admitted for consultation.

Code blue 40% 3- 6h
Code green 30% 1- 4h
Code yellow 10% 15- 60 min
Code orange 15% 1-10 min
Code red 5% immediately

According to the normal distribution, a medical consultation (ED employee) lasts 10 to 25
minutes. After the consultation, 20% of patients receive information about the need to be
admitted to the internal ward. Preparing documentation and informing the patient takes an ED
employee from 1 to 4 minutes according to a uniform distribution. The remaining patients are
treated by 2 ED employees and informed about further procedures (e.g., changing the dressing
or visiting a primary care facility). It takes from 5 to 25 minutes according to a normal
distribution.

Conduct a simulation of the emergency department's operation for six months.
1. Build a model of the cooperation process in BPMN notation.
2. Define and model process measures. Define the criteria for assessing effectiveness.
3. In the report, identify the simulation results that reflect the metrics achieved.
4. Propose actions to improve the efficiency of the process. Illustrate them with simulation results.
5. How many patients come to the Emergency Department every day? Show on a graph.
6. How many patients with each code are served on-site?
